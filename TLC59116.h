/// High Level interface to a single TLC59116 using Wire (I2C) interface.
/** 

  (see TLC59116_Unmanaged for lower level library)

  ### Usage:

  \include basic_usage_single/basic_usage_single.ino

  There are examples in the Arduino IDE examples, and of course, the download site https://github.com/2splat/arduino-TLC59116 .

  This high-level interface tracks each device's state so that commands appear to be independant.
  For example, you can set the digital-on of a channel without worrying about the 
  other 4 mode settings in each LEDOUTx_Register.

  Some optimization of the data sent to the devices is also done.

  ### The TLC59116 Device
  See the TI spec sheet for much detail: http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tlc59116.pdf

  - Output pins ("channels") are numbered 0..15.
  - Channels are "sinks", acting like Arduino pins that are LOW, even for PWM.
    - Connect the minus side of LEDs to the output pins.
    - Channels are considered ON, or OFF, instead of HIGH/LOW (or, at some PWM value)
    - PWM is 8 bit.
  - I2C addresses start at 0x60. See TLC59116_Unmanaged for the available addresses (up to 14).
  - The device provides a constant-current control (external and software settable).
    This means you can set the current, usually leave out resistors on each LED/channel, and is more efficient.
    See also, TLC59116::milliamps().
  - This library discovers the devices on the I2C bus and keeps them in a list.
    - Use the _index_ in this library: e.g. "0" is the device with the lowest address, 
      "1" is the next highest, etc.
    - This library exposes I2C addresses as 7bit addresses.
  - Individual devices cannot be "reset", all devices on the I2C bus are affected by a reset.
  - By default, all devices respond to broadcast ("allcall") commands (a special address).
    - This can be changed, or turned off, for each device (see TLC59116::allcall_address())
    - Three additional "broadcast" addresses can be set. See TLC59116::SUBADR_address()
    - Thus, a device can participate in 4 different broadcast groups (or none):
      - allcall_address()
      - SUBADR_address(0)
      - SUBADR_address(1)
      - SUBADR_address(2)
  - See the various groupings of the functions (below) for functionality.
  
  ### Protocol:

  - Setting up
    - Declare a static TLC59116Manager (static scope, or "static" keyword if you are very clever)
      \snippet allfeatures/allfeatures.ino Need a manager
    - Initialize the serial-output e.g.
      - `Serial.begin(9600)`
      - This library will warn you about some mistakes or dubious usages.
      - You don't have to setup the serial-output, but then you won't see the warnings.
      - I like to set the speed to 115200, because at that setting it has little effect 
        on the speed of your program.
    - Execute \ref TLC59116Manager::init() ".init()" for the manager once, usually in setup()
      \snippet allfeatures/allfeatures.ino Init the manager
    - The devices will then be in a ready state (by default, outputs are enabled, but all channels are off)
  - Obtain a reference from yourmanager\[i],  for i from 0..device_count()-1
    - This library passes and returns references so that "." can always be used.
      \snippet allfeatures/allfeatures.ino Static referencing devices
      \snippet allfeatures/allfeatures.ino Index referencing devices
  - Get information about the device as needed from the \ref Info Functions
      \snippet allfeatures/allfeatures.ino device info
  - Set device \ref Global Functions, \ref Group/Broadcast Addresses, \ref Software Current Control, typically in setup()
      \code{.cpp}
      void setup() {
      \endcode
      \snippet allfeatures/allfeatures.ino device setup
  - Do initial \ref Digital Functions, \ref PWM Functions, typically in setup()
      \snippet allfeatures/allfeatures.ino initial channel settings
  - During loop, mess with \ref Global Functions, \ref Group/Broadcast Addresses, \ref Software Current Control, \ref Digital Functions, \ref PWM Functions
  - This library returns the device-reference for most calls, so you can chain functions, e.g.:
    \snippet allfeatures/allfeatures.ino chain functions together

      Arduino DigitalWrite uses HIGH and LOW, but the device is a "sink", so "on" is actually a LOW.

      There are several aliases, and overloaded functions here (and for the pwm functions below). 
      The intention was to provide natural
      overloads and aliases. I've shied away from using the Arduino DigitalWrite and AnalogWrite so far.

      These functions only change the specified channels, they'll leave other outputs, like a PWM channel alone.

      You can have some channels doing PWM, and some channels doing digital.

    \warning The TLC59116 has a hardware bug:

    If you decrease the value (blink_time or brightness) in these functions,
    the chip may act like the value is max for one "cycle".
    This causes a full-brightness result for group_pwm, and a 10 second blink-length for group_blink.
    I think this is because:
    - There is a continously running timer, counting up.
    - The "value" is compared to the timer, and triggers the action and a reset of the timer.
    - If you move the "value" down, you may skip over the current timer value,
       so it runs to the maximum value before wrapping around again.
    "reset" is the only thing that I know of that will reset the timer.
    But, more experimentation is needed.
    
    I recommend you only set group functions once (or only increase values).

    Of course, you could TLC59116Manager::reset() everytime, too.
