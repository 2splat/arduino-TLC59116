### Arduino Library for TI TLC59116 LED-driver 

This provides a high level interface:

- Makes it easier to get started.
    - Discovers the devices.
    - Provides useful defaults.
- Provides most features.
- Provides operations at the feature level (like "turn on channel 4").
    - Manages the subfields and state of the device registers.
    - i.e.: only update the bits to turn channel 5 on, without stomping the other channels.
    - So you don't have to, which minimizes bugs.
    - Optimizes some communications with the device.
- Allows the friendlier "." notation, so you don't have to remember when to use "->".
- Provides a low-level interface if you don't want the state managed.

### Requirements

1.  An Arduino that is I2C capable, and works with the Wire library.
1.  Arduino IDE version 1.0.5, or 1.0.4. There is a bug that causes a problem in 1.0.6.
1.  At least one TLC59116, wired up and hooked to the default I2C pins of your Arduino.
    1.  Something on the outputs, otherwise it's real boring.

I have not tested this with any Makefile setups. Please send me info on how that works for you.

### Installation

1.  Download the [library zip file](https://github.com/2splat/arduino-TLC59116/raw/#BRANCH#/arduino_TLC59116.zip).
1.  Add the library to the Arduino IDE
    1.  (cf. the [official instructions](http://arduino.cc/en/guide/libraries))
    1.  For Arduino IDE 1.0.5:
        1. `Sketch -> Import Library -> Add Library`
        1. Then select the downloaded `arduino_TLC59116.zip`.
    1.  For earlier versions, follow the "Manual" section of <http://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/libraries>.

### Getting Started

1.  Copy the code from 
1.  Try the examples. 
    1. "examples/basic_usage_single" is the same code as show in the "Usage" section of [TLC59116 Class](https://2splat.github.io/arduino-TLC59116/classTLC59116.html)
        1.  Open it.
        1.  Do the Upload thing.
        1.  Oooh. Blinky light.
    1.  "examples/test_features" wants you to interact with the serial-console.
        1. Type single-letter commands into the top box, and click send. Try "?".
        1. It has a bunch of behaviors, useful for testing the TLC59116 and your wiring prowess.
    1.  "examples/allfeatures" is the source of most of the examples in the documenation.
        1. It compiles.
        1. It probably is not useful to actually run.
        1. But, you can copy & paste from it.
    1.  "examples/tlc59116blink" is what I use to do quick tests of wired-up devices.
        1. Read it's comments!
1.  Browse the [TLC59116 Class](https://2splat.github.io/arduino-TLC59116/classTLC59116.html) documentation page:
    1. The "Protocol" section describes the order you have to do things.
    1. Further down, the [Public Methods](http://2splat.github.io/arduino-TLC59116/classTLC59116.html#pub-methods) section has groups of operations (like "Digital" and "PWM").
       1. (you probably want to ignore that first list of methods)
       1. There's usually a short description of each method. 
       1. For example-code, explanations, and more details, click on the method-name.

### Documentation

HTML documentation, with examples, and explanation:

- Online: <https://2splat.github.io/arduino-TLC59116>
    - For the high-level/friendly, start at the [TLC59116 Class](https://2splat.github.io/arduino-TLC59116/classTLC59116.html)
    - NB: That is the current version's documentation. You can download other versions by going to the [repository](https://github.com/2splat/arduino-TLC59116), choosing the branch of interest, navigating to the `arduino_TLC59116_doc.zip`, and clicking on the "raw" button.
- Or, download a [zip](https://github.com/2splat/arduino-TLC59116/raw/#BRANCH#/arduino_TLC59116_doc.zip) of the documentation from the repository.
- Some known bugs are noted in the documentation (summary on ["Related Pages::Bugs"](https://2splat.github.io/arduino-TLC59116/bug.html)).
- Some things that aren't done are on the ["Related Pages::Todo"](https://2splat.github.io/arduino-TLC59116/todo.html)

### Developing

1.  Everything should be in the [github repository](https://github.com/2splat/arduino-TLC59116).
1.  Clone it to mess around. Fork it to keep track of the messing around.
1.  I'm happy to consider pull-requests, especially for bug-fixes, documentation issues, and missing functions.
    1.  Please maintain a high-level of documentation.
1.  Requirements for developing:
    1. Source control is by git, with a repository on github.
    1. Documentation is generated by doxygen: `doxygen Doxyfile`
    1. The .zip files are constructed by gnu-make.
    1. Several other files are constructed by gnu-make (e.g. `README.html`)
    1. The default `make` target constructs everything.
       1.  It tries to be tolerant of missing tools.
       1.  It touches up a few files to insert the git-branch as the version.
